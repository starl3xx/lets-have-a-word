          Every <strong>Let's Have A Word!</strong> player worldwide is hunting the same secret 5-letter word. Every incorrect guess helps everyone else by removing that word from play.

When someone guesses correctly, the round ends and the <strong>jackpot</strong> — the winner's share of the prize pool — is paid out automatically onchain. A new round then starts with a new secret word.</p>

          Before each round begins, Let's Have A Word <strong>commits onchain</strong> to the secret word using a cryptographic hash and hidden salt.
          <p className="mt-2">This commitment guarantees that the <strong>word cannot be changed mid-round</strong> — not by the game, not by the creator, not by anyone. Importantly, <strong>the creator does not know the secret word while the round is live</strong>. The word is only revealed after someone finds it.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">When a round ends:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-1 space-y-1">

      question: "How do Top 10 rewards work?",
      answer: (

          Top 10 rewards are based on <strong>early participation</strong> in each round.
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Only the first <strong>850 guesses</strong> in a round are eligible for Top 10 ranking</li>

            <li>Guesses after the lock can still win the jackpot, but do not affect Top 10 ranking</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">This incentivizes early guess purchasing during the high-uncertainty phase of the round and helps drive prize pool growth.</p>

          Share your unique referral link with friends or on the timeline. If anyone who joins using your link <strong>ever wins a jackpot</strong>, you'll automatically receive <strong>5% of that round's prize pool</strong>.
