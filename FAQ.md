# Let's Have A Word - FAQ

## How does the game work?

Every player worldwide guesses the same 5-letter word. When someone guesses correctly, they win the ETH jackpot and a new round starts with a new word. The jackpot grows with every paid guess.

## What are free guesses?

Every player gets 1 free guess per day. Free guesses don't cost anything but still give you a chance to win the jackpot. Additional free guesses can be earned through bonuses.

## How do I get more guesses?

You can earn bonus free guesses by: (1) Holding CLANKTON tokens (+3 guesses/day), (2) Sharing the game on Farcaster (+1 guess/day). You can also buy paid guess packs (up to 3 packs/day, 3 guesses each).

## What is CLANKTON bonus?

If you hold CLANKTON tokens in your connected wallet, you get 3 additional free guesses per day. This bonus is automatically detected when you connect.

## How does the share bonus work?

Share the game via Farcaster once per day to earn +1 free guess. The bonus is applied automatically after you share.

## How are paid guesses different?

Paid guesses cost ETH and contribute to the prize pool. You can buy up to 3 packs per day (3 guesses each). Paid guesses increase the jackpot for everyone.

## How is the jackpot split?

When someone wins: 80% goes to the winner, 10% goes to their referrer (if any), 10% split among the top 10 most active guessers that round. A small portion seeds the next round.

## What does "Provably Fair" mean?

Each round's answer is committed onchain before any guesses are made using a cryptographic hash. This means the answer cannot be changed after guesses start - it's mathematically provable that the game is fair.

## How do referrals work?

Share your referral link with friends. When someone you referred wins a jackpot, you automatically receive 10% of their winnings. You can track your referral earnings in the Referrals sheet.

## What happens to my unused guesses?

Free guess allocations reset daily at UTC midnight. Paid guess credits carry over between rounds but expire at the end of each day. Use them or lose them!

## Can I see the word after someone wins?

Yes! When a round is won, the answer is revealed to all players. You can also view past winning words and their cryptographic proofs.

## What is XP for?

XP is currently being tracked but has no gameplay effect yet. Future updates may add progression systems, leaderboards, or XP-based rewards. Stay tuned!
